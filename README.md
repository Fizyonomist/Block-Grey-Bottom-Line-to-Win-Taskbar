# Block-Grey-Bottom-Line-to-Win-Taskbar
Eliminate the annoying 2px grey line on Windows 11 hidden taskbars. Specially designed for OLED users to prevent visual distraction. This smart tool masks the line when windows are maximized, but auto-hides during fullscreen games or videos (YouTube/Netflix). Lightweight, click-through, and zero-interference. Clear your view!
